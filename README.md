- 👋 Hi, I’m @cavanj-pats
- 👀 I’m interested in gardening, old cars, and learning new things.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and learning to code in general.  
- 💞️ .

Mostly what i am trying to do here is document my learning.  However i work from my laptop and from a desktop and i'd like to be able to work on the same project from either machine....work on one machine then work on another then back to the first one....and keep track of changes.   

use what you want but I'm a noob.
